# MiddleEast-COVID19

This is part of a project where we explored the impact of COVID-19 on the some of MENA region countries, namely, Tunisia, Qatar, Iran, Jordan, and Lebanon. For this project I conducted topic modeling and some NLP analysis for some of the interviews we conducted

#### Methodology used:
Topical modeling helps to save time when we review lit by summarizing, cleaning, and lemmatizing text. Here are two examples of the outputs we have from our analysis.

#### Definition of Topic Modeling:
"In machine learning and natural language processing, a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents. Topic modeling is a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body"
